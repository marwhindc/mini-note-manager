## Mini Note Manager

A note manager app that lets you save, manage and switch on multiple notes in one screen

## Description

`Mini Note Manager` is an app from my personal project created as a helpful tool for my Service Desk team. This will allow us to manage notes by creating and deleting items and entering text for each item. All notes would only be in one screen as oppose to scrolling up and down from one text file.

## Download
